## Podfile
One of the ways to integrate Prebid Mobile SDK into the project is to use [CocoaPods]. After installing CocoaPods, locate where your `YourProjectName.xcodeproj` file is, and using Terminal go to that location. Use the command provided below to create `Podfile` in the location where the `YourProjectName.xcodeproj` file is.
```
pod init
```

Open the newly created `Podfile`, it should look like this:
```ruby
# Uncomment the next line to define a global platform for your project
# platform :ios, '9.0'

target 'YourProjectName' do
  # Comment the next line if you don't want to use dynamic frameworks
  use_frameworks!

  # Pods for YourProjectName

  target 'YourProjectNameTests' do
    inherit! :search_paths
    # Pods for testing
  end

  target 'YourProjectNameUITests' do
    # Pods for testing
  end

end
```

Inside the target `YourProjectName` and after the `use_frameworks!` line include these two lines, save the file and then close it.
```ruby
use_frameworks!
  pod 'PrebidMobile'
  pod 'Google-Mobile-Ads-SDK'
```

Using the terminal, install Prebid Mobile SDK and Google Ad Manager SDK using the command below.
```
pod install
```
If the installation is successful, you will find the `YourProjectName.xcworkspace` file located in the same folder where the 'YourProjectName.xcodeproj' is.

## Info.plist
Open the newly created `YourProjectName.xcworkspace` file. Then, in your project structure under your project, find the `Info.plist` file, it should be located like this: `YourProjectName -> YourProjectName -> Info`. It can be shown in the hierarchy just as `Info` instead of `Info.plist`.
Inside the Info.plist file, include the `GADApplicationIdentifier`. It is optional to include [SKAdNetworkItems] items.
```xml
<key>GADApplicationIdentifier</key>
<string>ca-app-pub-################~##########</string>
```

## SDK initialization
In the class where the banner will be shown, include these imports:
```swift
import PrebidMobile
import GoogleMobileAds
```

Make sure that your class adheres to the `GADBannerViewDelegate` protocol, e.g.
```swift
class ViewController: UIViewController, GADBannerViewDelegate {
```

Prebid Mobile SDK initialization is only needed to be done once. It can either be done inside a class method or a separate function.
```swift
func prebidInit(){
        Prebid.shared.prebidServerAccountId = ACCOUNT_ID;
        Prebid.shared.pbsDebug = true
        Prebid.shared.shareGeoLocation = true
        PrebidMobile.setTimeoutMillis(3000)

        do {
            try Prebid.shared.setCustomPrebidServer(url:"https://prebid.setupad.io/openrtb2/auction")
        } catch {
            print( \(error))
        }
        
        Prebid.initializeSDK(GADMobileAds.sharedInstance()) { status, error in
            switch status {
            case .succeeded:
                print("Prebid SDK successfully initialized")
            case .failed:
                if let error = error {
                    print("An error occurred during Prebid SDK initialization: \(error.localizedDescription)")
                }
            case .serverStatusWarning:
                if let error = error {
                    print("Prebid Server status checking failed: \(error.localizedDescription)")
                }
            default:
                break
            }
        }
    }
```
The `setTimeoutMillis` sets how much time bidders have to submit their bids. It is important to choose a sufficient timeout - if it is too short, there is a chance to get less bids, and if it is too long, it can slow down ad loading and user might wait too long for the ads to appear. If the `setShareGeoLocation` flag is set to true, then Prebid Mobile will send the userâ€™s geolocation to Prebid Server.
